# Vanilla-JavaScript-Drum-Machine :speaker:

This project is part of the 30 day vanilla JavaScript coding challenge **JavaScript30** by Wes Bos.
The idea is to build 30 projects in 30 days. No Frameworks, no compilers, no libraries, no boilerplate, only pure JavaScript.

## Functionality :white_check_mark:

- When I press the trigger key associated with each drum-pad, the audio clip contained in its child audio element should be triggered (e.g. pressing the A key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string "A", pressing the S key should trigger the drum pad which contains the string "S", etc.).
